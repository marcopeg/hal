| **Engine name** | `claude` |
| **CLI command** | `claude` |
| **Instructions file** | `CLAUDE.md` |
| **Skills directory** | `.claude/skills/` |

**Install and authenticate:**

```bash
# Install (native installer — no Node.js required)
curl -fsSL https://claude.com/install | bash

# Or via npm
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Authenticate (opens browser OAuth flow)
claude
```

Requires a Pro, Max, Teams, Enterprise, or API Console account. Credentials are stored in the system keychain.

**HAL usage:**

- **Config:** `engine.name: "claude"`. Optional: `engine.command`, `engine.model` (passed as `--model`), `engine.session`, `engine.sessionMsg`.
- **Invocation:** `claude -p <prompt> --output-format stream-json --verbose [--model <m>] [--resume <sessionId>]`
- **Sessions:** When `engine.session` is `true`, the CLI is invoked with `--resume {sessionId}`. HAL stores and passes a session ID per Telegram user, so each user has their own conversation thread. `/clean` clears the stored session and replies with a static message (no engine call).
- **Streaming:** JSONL output with live progress from tool-use events.
- **Project files:** `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/settings.json`.

### Instruction files and precedence

Claude Code uses **CLAUDE.md** only; it does **not** read `AGENTS.md` as a root instruction file. There is no built-in support for the AGENTS.md convention.

**Chain of instructions:** Yes. Multiple CLAUDE.md files are loaded and form a hierarchy:

1. **Ancestor load (at startup):** Claude walks **up** the directory tree from the current working directory and loads `CLAUDE.md` and `CLAUDE.local.md` from each directory. So if you run Claude in `foo/bar/`, it loads both `foo/bar/CLAUDE.md` and `foo/CLAUDE.md`. More specific (closer to cwd) takes precedence when there is conflict.
2. **Subdirectories:** CLAUDE.md files in subdirectories **below** the cwd are **not** loaded at launch; they are loaded on demand when Claude reads files in those directories.
3. **Other locations:** User instructions `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (all projects); optional managed policy (org-wide, OS-dependent). Project instructions can be in `./CLAUDE.md` or `./.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

**If both AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md exist:** Only CLAUDE.md is used. AGENTS.md is ignored.

You can pull in extra content from other files via `@path/to/file` imports inside CLAUDE.md, and use `.claude/rules/` for file-type–scoped rules. See [How Claude remembers your project](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/memory).
