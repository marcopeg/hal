# Skills

Skills follow the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io/). Each engine looks for skills in engine-specific directories (highest priority first). HAL reads them at boot and whenever `SKILL.md` files change. Skills are available to the engine, but only those with `telegram: true` are exposed as Telegram slash commands.

**Shared convention:** HAL documents skills using the **`.agents/skills/`** standard, so you can keep one shared set of skills across Copilot, Codex, OpenCode, and Cursor. **Claude Code does not support `.agents`**, so it is the exception — its skills live under `.claude/skills/`.

## Per-engine skill directories

| Engine       | Skill directories (priority order)                     |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Claude       | `.claude/skills`                                       |
| Codex        | `.agents/skills`                                       |
| Copilot      | `.agents/skills`, `.github/skills`, `.claude/skills`   |
| OpenCode     | `.agents/skills`, `.opencode/skills`, `.claude/skills` |
| Cursor       | `.agents/skills`, `.cursor/skills`                     |
| Antigravity  | `.agent/skills`                                        |

When the same skill name exists in multiple directories, the highest-priority directory wins (first-found).

## Structure

Each skill is a **folder** containing a `SKILL.md` file with a YAML frontmatter block and a prompt body:

```
{project-cwd}/
└── .agents/skills/
    └── chuck/
        └── SKILL.md
```

## SKILL.md format

```markdown
---
name: chuck
title: Chuck Norris
description: Tells a joke about Chuck Norris.
telegram: true
---

Tell a short, funny joke about Chuck Norris.
```

- **Folder name** is used as the command name. If the frontmatter `name` field differs from the folder name, the bot logs a warning and uses the folder name.
- `title` is optional from HAL's runtime perspective, but recommended for human readability in skill files and helper tooling.
- The **body** is the prompt sent to the AI when the user invokes the skill.

> **Note:** The SKILL.md prompt body is sent as-is. There is no variable substitution (`${}`, `@{}`, or bar-style `|var|`) applied to skill prompts. If you need dynamic values, use a custom command.

## Exposing skills to Telegram

By default, skills are **not** exposed as Telegram slash commands. To make a skill available in Telegram (in the `/help` menu and via direct invocation), you must add `telegram: true` to its YAML frontmatter. The `telegram: true` flag is case-insensitive.

When `telegram: true` is present, the skill is exposed using its folder name / `name` as the Telegram slash command name, so it must follow Telegram's Bot API command rules:

- 1 to 32 characters
- lowercase English letters, digits, and underscores only

The skill `description` is also reused in Telegram command surfaces and must fit Telegram's Bot API limit:

- 1 to 256 characters

If a skill should remain engine-only and not appear as a Telegram slash command, omit `telegram: true`.

## How invocation works

When a user invokes a skill command (e.g. `/chuck`):

1. The bot reads the `SKILL.md` prompt body
2. Appends any user arguments as `User input: {args}` if present
3. Calls the AI engine with that prompt via the engine-agnostic `agent.call()` interface
4. Sends the response back to the user

## Overriding a skill with a custom command

You can replace a skill with your own handler: create a [custom command](../custom-commands/README.md) `.hal/commands/{name}.mjs` with the same name as the skill. The `.mjs` handler takes full precedence.

If that custom command later returns `{ type: 'agent' }`, HAL forwards the selected message directly to the engine path. It does not bounce back through the direct skill shortcut for that same slash command.

**Command precedence** (highest wins):

```
project .hal/commands/{name}.mjs  >  global .hal/commands/{name}.mjs  >  engine skills (see table above)
```
